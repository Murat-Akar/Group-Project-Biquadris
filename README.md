**Biquadris: A Two-Player Block-Dropping Game**

# Biquadris is a strategic, turn-based adaptation of the classic Tetris game, designed for two players. The game extends the traditional Tetris gameplay into a dual-player competitive format where each player has their own 11x15 grid. Players take turns placing tetrominoes on their board, aiming to complete full rows to keep their board clear. Unlike real-time Tetris, Biquadris allows players to take time in deciding where to place each block, adding a layer of strategic depth. Each piece played influences the next piece the opponent will have to place, making each move critical as players work not only to clear their own board but also to outmaneuver their opponent.
